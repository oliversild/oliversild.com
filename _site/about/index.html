    <p>Hi, my name is Oliver Sild. I was born in 1993 in a small country known as Estonia. I’m living in a small city with less than 40,000 people.</p>

<p>In primary school, I ran my own private servers for games and created dynamic SMS services to earn my first pocket-money.</p>

<p>Hacking in the games was a regular thing, so finding ways to address these issues quickly became my main interest.</p>

<p>I studied IT and I’m a certified computer networking specialist. During my studies I also became a volunteer in Estonian Defence League’s Cyber Unit (Pärnu).</p>

<p>I quit my studies and started my own company which focused on web development and website security.</p>

<p>Few years later, I founded WebARX and co-founding a coworking space and kickstarted the start-up ecosystem in Pärnu, Estonia.</p>

<p>In late 2020, my co-founded NGO named CTF Pärnu also opened the first Hackerspace in Pärnu, Estonia.</p>

<p>I believe in communities, personal development and lifelong learning. Big cities are over-rated and life-quality in small- close to nature cities is the future!</p>

<p>Big things can be done from anywhere!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Oliver is the innovator who wakes up in the middle of the night after dreaming about a new startup idea to pitch the new idea to his team. He is extremely good at communication and motivating people. He is a strong believer in self-development and continuous learning. He’s a great CEO who truly values his employees.</p>

    <p>Agnes Talalaev (CMO at WebARX)</p>
