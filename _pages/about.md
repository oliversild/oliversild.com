Hi, my name is Oliver Sild. I was born in 1993 in a small country known as Estonia. I'm living in a small city with less than 40,000 people.

In primary school, I ran my own private servers for games and created dynamic SMS services to earn my first pocket-money. 

Hacking in the games was a regular thing, so finding ways to address these issues quickly became my main interest.

I studied IT and I'm a certified computer networking specialist. During my studies I also became a volunteer in Estonian Defence League’s Cyber Unit (Pärnu). 

I quit my studies and started my own company which focused on web development and website security.

Few years later, I founded WebARX and co-founding a coworking space and kickstarted the start-up ecosystem in Pärnu, Estonia. 

In late 2020, my co-founded NGO named CTF Pärnu also opened the first Hackerspace in Pärnu, Estonia.

I believe in communities, personal development and lifelong learning. Big cities are over-rated and life-quality in small- close to nature cities is the future! 

Big things can be done from anywhere!
